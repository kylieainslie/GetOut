Description: Sequential and batch change detection for univariate data
        streams, using the change point model framework. Functions are
        provided to allow the parametric monitoring of sequences of
        Gaussian and Bernoulli random variables, along with more
        general nonparametric functions for monitoring sequences which
        have an unspecified or unknown distribution.
